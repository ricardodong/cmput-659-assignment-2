# cmput-659-assignment-2
using Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to imitate UCT search result in small size can't stop game

# running the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
```
python MH.py
```

# input and output
The program takes no input and will print r1 to r5. 
<\br>
The parameters are:

```
# UCT parameters 
c = 1 
simulation = 100
number_of_rounds_played = 20

# MH parameters
sample_times  = 1000
